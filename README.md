# go-fhir-structs

This repository contains Go structs that match FHIR R4 resources.

It was generated using https://github.com/savannahinformatics/fhir ,
which is itself a fork of
https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir-golang-generator .

It's original use case is to act as a source of structs that simplify
marshalling and unmarshalling of FHIR R4 resources in a Go server.

It has no further ambition beyond that.
