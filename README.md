# autogenerated-go-fhir

This is an experimental Golang FHIR R4 server.

It has been auto-generated using https://github.com/savannahinformatics/fhir .
The code generation is a fork of https://github.com/intervention-engine/fhir-golang-generator 
that was updated for FHIR R4.

This server is not meant to be run as-is. Our own internal use case is to use
it as a source of Go structs / models that are incorporated into our server(s).
